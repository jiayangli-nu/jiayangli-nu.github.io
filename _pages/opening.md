I am actively seeking self-motivated Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers with strong mathematical and/or programming backgrounds to join my lab starting in 2025 Spring or 2025 Fall. I am also happy to host remote undergraduate research interns.  Below is a brief introduction to my research and information about the available positions.


### **An Introduction to My Research**

My research focuses on integrating optimization, game theory, and machine learning to address operations research challenges, particularly within transportation and mobility systems. My past and ongoing research includes the following topics:

- Designing scalable and principled algorithms that can handle complex bilevel programming problems.

- Developing behavioral theory for understanding travelers' decision-making in transportation systems.

- Creating innovative frameworks for traffic system planning that ensure both fairness and efficiency.

- Leveraging information design to optimize the deployment and operation of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and electric vehicles (EVs).

Looking ahead, I am eager to expand my research to other topics, including application domains beyond transportation and mobility. If you are interested in joining my lab, I definitely welcome collaborations on these established topics. **Even more, I look forward to you bringing new research challenges and ideas to the table.**


### **Ph.D. Positions**


I am looking for 1-2 self-motivated Ph.D. students to join my research group in 2025 Spring or 2025 Fall. Successful applicants should meet the following criteria.

- Strong mathematical and/or programming skills.

- A B.S. degree in related fields such as optimization, statistics, economics, applied mathematics, computer science, industrial engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, environmental science, etc. As operations research is highly interdisciplinary, I do not expect candidates to have backgrounds in very specific fields.

- Good writing and communication skills in English.

Successful applicants are normally considered eligible to receive a Postgraduate Scholarship (PGS) during the normative study period. The basic level of scholarship is HK$18,760 per month. Outstanding applicants are also strongly encouraged to apply for the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship scheme (HKPFS) and the Presidential Fellowship of the University of Hong Kong (HKU-PS), which offer a stipend of HK$28,100 per month plus a conference and research-related travel allowance of HK$14,000 per year. HKU will also provide HKPF and HKU-PS awardees additional living and accommodation support (HK$40,000 in the first year and HK$20,000 per year in the remaining normative study period).

If you are interested, please email me at jiayangl@hku.hk with the following materials:

- Your up-to-date CV.

- Your (unofficial) transcript.

- A research question that interests you the most.



### **Postdoctoral Positions**

I am also looking for 1-2 postdoctoral researchers to join my research group in Spring 2025 or Fall 2025. The basic salary is no less than HK$30,000 per month. Outstanding candidates are strongly encouraged to apply for the RGC Postdoctoral Fellowship Scheme (PDFS).

If you are interested, please email me at jiayangl@hku.hk with the following materials:

- Your up-to-date CV.

- 1--2 of your publications.

- A research statement detailing your past and current research projects, as well as your future research plans.

I will review your publications and research statement with sincerity to see if our research objectives align.


### **Undergraduate Internship Positions**

I am also happy to host remote research interns for undergraduate students who are interested in applying for a Ph.D. in any country or region. Please feel free to contact me anytime to discuss potential research projects that may be suitable for you.
