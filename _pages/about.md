I am a **Ph.D. candidate** in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/civil-environmental/) at Northwestern University and an incoming **tenured-track assistant professor** in the [Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering](https://www.imse.hku.hk/) at the University of Hong Kong. I received my B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from Tsinghua University in 2019.

My research aims to bring together **optimization**, **game theory**, and **machine learning** to address **operations research** challenges, particular within transportation and mobility systems. Looking ahead, I am looking forward to expanding my research to other complex systems, including infrastructure, energy, environmental systems and beyond. The ultimate goal of my research is to enhance the quality of life across diverse human habitats.


<p><strong>Openings</strong></p>

I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers with a strong mathematical and/or programming background for 2025 Fall.  I am also happy to host remote undergraduate research interns for 2024 Summer. If you have interests, please reach me directly by email at <a href="mailto:jiayangl@hku.hk">jiayangl@hku.hk</a>.
