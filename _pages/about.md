I am an **tenured-track assistant professor** in the [Department of Data and Systems Engineering](https://www.dase.hku.hk/) at the University of Hong Kong. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in transportation systems analysis from Northwestern University in 2024 and my B.S. degree in mathematics from Tsinghua University in 2019.

My research aims to bring together **optimization**, **game theory**, and **machine learning** to address **operations research** challenges, particular within transportation and mobility systems. Looking ahead, I am looking forward to expanding my research to other complex systems, including infrastructure, energy, environmental systems and beyond. The ultimate goal of my research is to enhance the quality of life across diverse human habitats.


<p><strong>Openings</strong></p>

I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers with a strong mathematical and/or programming background for 2025 Spring and 2025 Fall.  I am also happy to host remote undergraduate research interns. If you have interests, please reach me directly by email at <a href="mailto:jiayangl@hku.hk">jiayangl@hku.hk</a>.
