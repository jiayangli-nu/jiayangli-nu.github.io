My paper titled "A Day-to-Day Dynamical Approach to the Most Likely User Equilibrium Problem" is accepted by [Transportation Science (TS)](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/trsc). It will also be presented at the [25th International Symposium on Traffic and Transportation Theory](https://limos.engin.umich.edu/isttt25/) (ISTTT).
